# ðŸ”„ Pacing & Narrative Ideas
After player completes final level, they are taken back to first level. Completing first level this time displays a winning time (how many ghosts + time to complete). If less than 50% and minimum number of ghosts, award trophy. If not, say how far off player is. If all levels beaten for trophy, then game over.
